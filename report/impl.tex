\section{Implementation}
\label{s:impl}

To evaluate the efficacy of our version locks, we compare it against two popular
concurrency control schemes : \textit{reader-writer lock} and \textit{lock-free}.
We implement three variants of an open chaining hash table, each integrated with
one of the aforementioned concurrency control mechanism. We use the same number of
hash buckets for each hash table implementation.
We use the YCSB workloads
to evaluate performance of the hash table variants, details are discussed in
\autoref{s:eval:env}. Our implementation is publicly available at
\url{https://github.com/madhavakrishnan/version-lock}
In our repository, we provide the implementation of our hash table variants
as well as detailed steps to generate the YCSB workloads.
