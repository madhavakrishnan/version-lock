Traditional lock based
pessimistic concurrency control (PCC) techniques are easy to use and are
widely available in the standard library (e.g., POSIX). But such PCC based locks
(e.g., Mutex) is know for their poor scalability with the increasing number of
threads. On the other hand, lock-free programming (OCC) enables better
scalability but it is notoriously hard to program even the simple data
structures. Writing complex data structures such as B+tree requires some serious
engineering effort if not impossible. 

To overcome this problem, we propose \sys, an optimistic concurrency control 
(OCC) technique that focuses on performance, scalability, and simplicity. 
We designed \sys using C++ and we expose the \sys with a simple set of
APIs as found in the C++ standard library and POSIX library. We designed a
hashtable with \sys and evaluated it using the YCSB workloads. We
compare \sys's performance with the RW lock (PCC) and lock-free hashtable (OCC).
Over results show that, \sys outperforms RW lock by up to 40\% and it performs
on par or better than lock-free while being much simple to use than lock-free.
